- `_redirects`: SPA routing rules (Netlify)
- `_headers`: Security and cache headers (Netlify)

### Important Notes

- The main HTML file is `orbitv7.html`
- All routes redirect to `orbitv7.html` for SPA functionality
- Images use Unsplash CDN with gradient fallbacks
- No build process required - static HTML deployment

### Environment Variables (Optional)

If you want to use Supabase or OpenAI services, create a `.env` file or set environment variables in Netlify:

```
SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
```

Then update `config.supabase.js` and `config.openai.js` to use these variables.
